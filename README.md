# SEO-blogs-in-Peace
Allows viewing of some popular blogs without annoying self promotional ads. Currently only Neil Patel's /blog part of his site, I will add more as I get frustrated with sites. I know there is plenty to add. :P

Currently the code is very simple and to install on Chrome Simply follow this once guide after unzipping repositories:

Feel free to add to this if you want and make changes if you notice any issues. With all this twitter publicity I hope it actually works for everyone! Well, until Neil updates his site. Then I'll make sure to do a update.
